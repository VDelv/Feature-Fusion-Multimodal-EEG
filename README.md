# Towards Innovative Approaches for Multimodal EEG Signal Processing

Implementation of the proposed approaches to fuse EEG signals with other modalities.

## Instruction

The three approaches presented in the paper are available in three notebooks:
* [Compact Bilinear Pooling](Naive_Fusion.ipynb)
* [FiLM](FiLM_Fusion.ipynb)
* [Multi Head Attention](Attention_Fusion.ipynb)
